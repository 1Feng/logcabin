`logo.svg` is the official logo for LogCabin.

In case you're wondering, no, those lines aren't straight. Every point on the
image is positioned by hand, poorly, intentionally.

The font used is called "Cabin", of course. It's available in the Debian
package `fonts-cabin` and from http://www.impallari.com/cabin/ under the SIL
Open Font License.

`LogCabin.gpl` is a GIMP/Inkscape color palette for the colors used in the logo.

`500px.png` is a 500 pixel-wide PNG export of `logo.svg` with a white background.
